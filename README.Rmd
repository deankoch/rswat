# rswat

An R package for SWAT+ input/output file management

`rswat` edits and runs SWAT+ models. See our other project [`rswat.maker`](https://github.com/deankoch/rswat.maker) for an R-based workflow to build QSWAT+ projects and turn them into a SWAT+ models.

## Workflow

`rswat` uses R data frames to represent SWAT+ the parameter tables on disk. Users can explore existing projecst, execute simulations, train models, and view the results, all from within the R-environment. 

## Example

Check out our [Introduction article](https://github.com/deankoch/rswat/blob/main/vignettes/articles/rswat_intro.md) for quick tour of the major features in `rswat`

```{r soda, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', fig.dim=c(6, 6)}
knitr::include_graphics('vignettes/articles/rswat_intro_files/figure-gfm/source-project-1.png')
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of rswat in R by doing:

``` r
devtools::install_github('deankoch/rswat')
```

Users who want to run simulations from rswat must also have a copy of the SWAT+ simulator executable on their local machine (this is included in the [SWAT+ installer](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/)).
