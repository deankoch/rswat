\usage{
rswat_summarize_files(
  files_df,
  loaded = NA,
  known = NA,
  n = NULL,
  level = "file",
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files_df}{data frame, output from \code{rswat_files}}

\item{loaded}{logical, indicates that the files are all loaded}

\item{known}{logical, indicates that the files are all recognized by rswat}

\item{n}{integer, the maximum number of results to print}

\item{level}{character, what category to summarize over (see details)}
}
\value{
returns a data frame invisibly, and prints the first \code{n} lines of it
}
\description{
A helper function for \code{rswat_files} to print file information in the console.
\code{level} specifies the detail level for the output. The default \code{level='file'}
returns information about every file on its own row.
}
\details{
With \code{level='group'} each group gets a row, indicating how many files there are
and how many are loaded, along with a list of the file names (truncated to the
console width, or \code{max_len} if it is assigned). \code{level='type'} does the same but
with summaries of the four file types, and shows group names within each type
category instead of file names.

\code{n} controls the maximum number of rows to print in the console (all rows are
returned invisibly by the function). \code{loaded} and \code{known} modify the message
printed about the files.
